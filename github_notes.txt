1. Create a github acc
2. create a repository
3. create a text file(for sample)
4. commands(from github to pc):
 git clone https://github.com/harshaya13/github.git
https://github.com/harshaya13/github.git---> copied from the code button(then copy link there)---> new git copy folder will be created
5. git status ---> to show untracked files

4.(what happend?)--> file from github --> git copy folder(NEW FOLDER WILL BE CREATED) --> working folder

NOTE: the files to be commited to the respository should be in the same git copy folder
5. check for the untracked files(git status)
6. git add <filename_withextension>--> example: git add sample.txt
7. check again "git status"
8. git commit -m "commit message"
NOTE : even after this process no changes are made in the github.
why? it is beacuse the files are still present in the git copy folder.

9. git push origin main
origin --(the link we copied(repository))
my folder will be in the main branch
git repository->main branch-> file
 
recap:
(created a file)insert--> add-->commit-->push

DELETING A FILE FROM THE REPOSITORY:
1. delete the file from the local folder
2. git status
3. git add filname.extension
4. git commit -m "msg(can be anything) for ex: deleted sample.txt"
note : the file will not be deleted still
5. git push origin main

FROM GITHUB ACC TO LOCAL PC:
note: 
1. clone if there is no git copy folder in your pc first
   if it is cloned new all the changes made will be there
2. if there is a git copy folder already: just go to the folder in cmd(git copy folder should 
   be the current directory) and give:
                                    git pull
                                    --> changes will be updated!
